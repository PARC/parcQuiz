        Iconoclastic lone predators who often grow by acquisition.  Tigers tend to be lean and profitable, and approach innovation in a focused way.
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Tigers have relatively strong strategic focus on key products and markets, but often donâ€™t look for future growth spaces.</li>
        <li>Tigers invest strategically in key innovation programs, often via centralized R&D functions, that support core business lines.</li>
        <li>Strong leadership that is usually financially-driven to deliver high margins from lean operations.</li>
        <li>Tigers are potentially vulnerable to paradigm shifts in their industry, such as from entrants with disruptive technologies or business models.</li>
